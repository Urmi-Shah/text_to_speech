# 🗣️ Speech-to-Text Converter

## 📝 Overview

This project is a simple web-based **Speech-to-Text Converter** that allows users to transcribe their speech into text in real-time. By clicking on the 🎤 microphone button, the application will start listening to the user's speech, convert it to text, and display it in a text area. The app also provides visual feedback by displaying "Recording Started" and "Recording Stopped" messages.

## ✨ Features
